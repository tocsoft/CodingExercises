Code Exercises
============================

To get started run `unlock.ps1` to unlock the first exercise.

Each exercise consists of a readme describing the test, and a scaffolded out test project for you to implement your code.

Use the provided tests (make sure to un-skip any tests are required) to verify your work... once you have a completed an exercise run `unlock.ps1` again to unlock the next test. We will add some more tests as part of unlock to ensure your code compiles and passes before we will unlock the next one.
